Module  : Go To Topic 
Version : 1.0.2
Authors : Brian Moon <brian@phorum.org>

This module implements the Go To Topic concept from Phorum 3.
It allows the user to jump back to the exact list page on which a message
that was read or written resides. Phorum 5 only implements the Message List
link, which will always jump to the first list page.


Installation instructions:
--------------------------

1) Install the module

    - Unpack the archive;

    - Move the directory "go_to_topic" to the directory "mods"
      within your Phorum installation;

    - Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
      go to the "Modules" section;

    - Enable the module "Go To Topic".

2) Edit your templates

    - Edit your read.tpl and read_threads.tpl to include a "go to topic" link.
      This can be done by adding a link to the navigation which looks like:

        <a href="{GO_TO_TOPIC_URL}">{GO_TO_TOPIC}</a>

      The {GO_TO_TOPIC} template variable contains the language string for
      "Go To Topic". You can change the language files for this module
      if you need a different link title or you can simply replace
      {GO_TO_TOPIC} with whatever text/html you like.

      You can also modify the existing Message List menu item in the read
      templates instead, to have them point to the topic's list page. 
      If you want to do that, then find:

        href="{URL->TOP}"

      Replace that code with

        href="{GO_TO_TOPIC_URL}"

    - If you want your browser to jump to the thread from which you are
      returning on the list page, then edit list.tpl and list_threads.tpl
      and find:

        <a href="{ROWS->url}">{ROWS->subject}</a>

      Replace that code with:

        <a name="msg-{ROWS->message_id}" href="{ROWS->url}">{ROWS->subject}</a>

      Without this code change, Phorum will jump to the correct list page,
      but the page will not scroll down to the message that you are returning
      from.
