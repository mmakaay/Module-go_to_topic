Module  : Go To Topic
Version : 1.2.2
Authors : Brian Moon <brian@phorum.org>

This module implements the Go To Topic concept from Phorum 3.
It allows the user to jump back to the exact list page on which a message
that was read or written resides. Phorum 5 only implements the Message List
link, which will always jump to the first list page.


Installation instructions:
--------------------------

1) Install the module

    - Unpack the archive;

    - Move the directory "go_to_topic" to the directory "mods"
      within your Phorum installation;

    - Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
      go to the "Modules" section;

    - Enable the module "Go To Topic".

    - Edit the settings for the "Go To Topic" module. There is only one
      setting: "Automatically replace list URLs". If you enable this feature,
      then you are done. All the list URLs on the read page will be
      automatically replaced with the Go To Topic URL. If you disable this
      feature and want to add the Go To Topic URLs manually to your
      templates, then continue with section 2.


2) Edit your templates (only if "Automatically replace list URLs" is disabled)

    By default, the module is configured to replace the list URLs
    with the Go To Topic URL when coming from a read page. If you
    disable this feature in the settings for the module, then you can
    fully control where to use the Go To Topic URL. You will have to update
    your templates for this.

    - Edit your read.tpl, ready_hybrid.tpl and read_threads.tpl to include a
      "go to topic" link. This can be done by adding a link to the navigation
      which looks like:

        <a href="{GO_TO_TOPIC_URL}">{GO_TO_TOPIC}</a>

      The {GO_TO_TOPIC} template variable contains the language string for
      "Go To Topic". You can change the language files for this module
      if you need a different link title or you can simply replace
      {GO_TO_TOPIC} with whatever text/html you like.

      You can also modify the existing Message List menu item in the read
      templates instead, to have them point to the topic's list page.
      If you want to do that, then find:

        href="{URL->LIST}"

      Replace that code with

        href="{GO_TO_TOPIC_URL}"

    - If you want your browser to jump down the page to the thread from
      which you are returning on the message list page, then edit
      list.tpl and list_threads.tpl and find:

        <a href="{MESSAGES->URL->READ}"

      Replace that code with:

        <a name="msg-{MESSAGES->message_id}" href="{MESSAGES->URL->READ}"

      Without this code change, Phorum will jump to the correct list page,
      but the page will not scroll down to the message that you are returning
      from.
