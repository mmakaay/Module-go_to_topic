2011-04-01 v1.2.2 by Maurice Makaay

    - Some small changes to the database layer, trying to work around
      a possible performance issue.

2011-01-21 v1.2.1 by Maurice Makaay

    - Fixed redirection when coming from a sticky thread. Without this
      fix, the module redirected to the page on which the sticky message 
      had been when it had been unsticky. Now, when returning from a
      sticky message, the first page is always loaded.

2010-10-09 v1.2.0 by Maurice Makaay

    - Fixed an edge case situation, where the module would not jump back
      to the correct list page, when there were a few messages bearing
      the same timestamp around the page separation.

    - Make use of new hooks in Phorum 5.2.16+ to optimize the module.

    - Added a configurable feature to automatically replace list URLs
      on the read page with the Go To Topic URL. This takes away the
      need to modify the templates.

      If you are upgrading from an older version of this module, then
      beware that this option is enabled by default in the settings.
      If you are using both {URL->LIST} and {GO_TO_TOPIC_URL} in your
      templates, then disable the feature.

    - When using the above feature, the breadcrumb that points to the
      forum will also be modified to use the Go To Topic URL instead
      of the plain forum URL.

    - Added new German language files. Thanks to Oliver Riesen!

2008-07-30 v1.1.2 by Maurice Makaay

    - A README documentation update to make the template variables
      that are referenced for modifying the template compatible
      with those that are used in the Phorum 5.2 templates.

2008-04-21 v1.1.1 by Maurice Makaay

    - Jumping to the posted message in the message list after posting
      a message is now only enabled if in the "General Settings" admin page
      the option "After posting goto" is set to "Message List Page".

2007-04-12 v1.1.0 by Maurice Makaay

    - Branched the module for separating 5.1 and 5.2 support (5.2 uses
      a different database layer API).

2007-04-12 v1.0.2 by Maurice Makaay

    - If a forum is read in threaded mode, then the anchor
      #msg-<message id> is used instead of #msg-<thread id>.

    - Added a workaround for an MSIE redirect bug (MSIE strips anchor info
      from URLs when the redirect is done by a script that received a
      multi-part POST request). Now, jumping to the #msg-... anchor works
      after posting from MSIE too.

2007-04-12 v1.0.1 by Maurice Makaay

    - Turned the module into a multi file module, to be able to add
      some features.

    - Added language file support.

    - Typo "gotogopic" -> "gototopic" fixed.

    - Changed some deprecated code constructions which were in the module
      because they were introduced at the time of writing for the
      dealnews.com website.

    - Fixed an off-by-one bug in determining what page to show. Jumping
      back to the very first message on a list page let the user jump
      to the page before the correct page instead.

    - Made the module work when jumping back from the read page on a forum
      that has "float to top" enabled.

    - Implemented code for handling multiple database layers (mysql, mysqli
      and postgresql).

2007-04-12 v1.0.0 by Brian Moon

    - Initial release
