Changelog:
----------

2007-04-12 v1.0.2 by Maurice Makaay

    - If a forum is read in threaded mode, then the anchor
      #msg-<message id> is used instead of #msg-<thread id>.

    - Added a workaround for an MSIE redirect bug (MSIE strips anchor info
      from URLs when the redirect is done by a script that received a
      multi-part POST request). Now, jumping to the #msg-... anchor works
      after posting from MSIE too.

2007-04-12 v1.0.1 by Maurice Makaay

    - Turned the module into a multi file module, to be able to add
      some features.

    - Added language file support.

    - Typo "gotogopic" -> "gototopic" fixed.

    - Changed some deprecated code constructions which were in the module
      because they were introduced at the time of writing for the
      dealnews.com website.

    - Fixed an off-by-one bug in determining what page to show. Jumping
      back to the very first message on a list page let the user jump 
      to the page before the correct page instead.

    - Made the module work when jumping back from the read page on a forum
      that has "float to top" enabled.

    - Implemented code for handling multiple database layers (mysql, mysqli
      and postgresql).
